Hi :) welcome to my website!

### About me

I am Jade (Xiaoqing) Wang, and I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University. Previsouly, I was a postdoc in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan advised by Prof. [Xiang Zhou](https://xiangzhou.github.io/), focusing on developing statistical and DL/AI methods for spatial transcriptomics data. Before that, I was a postdoc in Biostatistics at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, advised by Dr. [Yimei Li](https://www.stjude.org/directory/l/yimei-li.html) and Dr. Zhao-Hua Lu, working with Dr.  [Wilburn E. Reddick](https://www.stjude.org/directory/r/wilburn-reddick.html) and Dr. [Heather Conklin](https://www.stjude.org/directory/c/heather-conklin.html) on developing statistical and DL/AI methods for imaging, genetics, and text data for cancer clinical trials.

### Research Interests
* Statistical and DL/AI methods in genetics/genomics data analysis, e.g. spatial transcriptomics
* Statistical and DL/AI methods in imaging/network data analysis, e.g. neuroimages and histology images
* And, high-dimensional spatial models, DL/AI applications, nonhomogeneous Poisson process, mediation analysis, longitudinal data, latent variable models, multi-modality data integration, Bayesian methods.
