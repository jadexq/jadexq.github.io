Hi :) welcome to my website!

### About Me

I am Jade (Xiaoqing) Wang, and I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University. Previsouly, I was a postdoc in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan advised by Prof. [Xiang Zhou](https://xiangzhou.github.io/), focusing on developing statistical and DL/AI methods for spatial transcriptomics data. Before that, I was a postdoc in Biostatistics at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, advised by Dr. [Yimei Li](https://www.stjude.org/directory/l/yimei-li.html) and Dr. [Zhao-Hua Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhaohua-lu-79367816/), working with Dr.  [Wilburn E. Reddick](https://www.stjude.org/directory/r/wilburn-reddick.html) and Dr. [Heather Conklin](https://www.stjude.org/directory/c/heather-conklin.html) on developing statistical and DL/AI methods for imaging, genetics, and text data for cancer clinical trials.

### Research Interests
* Statistical and DL/AI methods in genetics/genomics data analysis, e.g. spatial transcriptomics
* Statistical and DL/AI methods in imaging/network data analysis, e.g. neuroimages, networks, and histology images
* And, high-dimensional spatial models, AI agents, 3D reconstruction and data analysis, nonhomogeneous Poisson process, mediation analysis, longitudinal data, latent variable models, multi-modality data integration, Bayesian methods.

### Open Positions
I can recruit PhD students for the incoming 2026 Fall admission cycle. Students with strong interests and related background are welcome to contact me preferably in Feb (no later than Mar) 2026. Please send a brief description of your research interests and motivation, CV (preferably with names of your references), and transcripts to jadewang@tamu.edu. 

Students and researchers interested in working with me as a postdoc fellow or research assistant are also welcome to reach out. 

I am open to working with graduate and undergraduate students (both in person and distance) on related research projects. For example, statistical/DL/AI methods/applications in spatial transcriptomics/proteomics, 3D reconstruction and analysis, brain images/networks, AI agents and LLM applications, neuroimaging data preprocessing, and virtual cell.
